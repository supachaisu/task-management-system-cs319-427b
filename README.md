Supachai Suwanthip 1660708619 CS319/ 427B

The system allows the team to manage tasks, assign tasks to team members, and track completion status.

## Part 1: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

The source code is in [/src/answers.ts](src/answers.ts).

## Part 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism

I add a new class `PriorityTask` that extends `Task` and overrides the `markCompleted` method.

The source code is in [/src/answers.ts](src/answers.ts).

I use the `override` keyword to override the `markCompleted` method in the `PriorityTask` class.

## Part 3: Type Annotations and Interfaces

The source code is in [/src/answers.ts](src/answers.ts).
